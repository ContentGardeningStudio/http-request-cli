"""Example project: HTTP request CLI.

This package exposes two command-line interfaces:

- ``http-argparse``: implemented with :mod:`argparse`
- ``http-typer``: implemented with :mod:`typer`

They intentionally share similar behaviour so you can compare the developer
experience and ergonomics of each approach.
